# DevOps Project: Docker & Nginx Landing Page

Welcome to my first DevOps project! This project demonstrates how to use Docker and Nginx to serve a simple landing page.

## Project Overview 

This project involves the following steps:

1. Launching an AWS Instance – Setting up an EC2 instance to run the project.
2. Installing Docker and Nginx – Setting up Docker to run Nginx in a container.
3. Creating a Simple Landing Page – The page is built using HTML and served by Nginx.
4. Deploying the Application – The landing page is served on port 80, using Nginx running inside a Docker container.

## Key Technologies Used

- AWS EC2 Instance
- Docker
- Nginx
- HTML (Landing Page)

## Purpose

This project helps in understanding the basic principles of DevOps by using Docker to containerize Nginx and deploying a simple landing page. It provides a great starting point for anyone looking to dive into the world of containerization and web server management.

## Future Improvements

- Implement SSL/TLS for secure connections.
- Add CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Use cloud storage for managing static assets.
